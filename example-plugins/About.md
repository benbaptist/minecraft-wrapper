# Overview #

Example Plugins are the older example plugins.  They are for example
purposed only, but may generally function and provide examples
of how to write a wrapper plugin, as well as demonstrate wrapper functions.

Although not free of errors, and may not even work anymore, these can be adapted
into more robust versions with additional work.  If you wish to improve
or add a new plugin, submit your pull request to the `submitted-plugins`
directory.

If you are looking for final, ready-use, working plugins that meet the
current Wrapper.py API, use those plugins in the `stable-plugins`
directory.

####These plugins are not necessarily working or maintained.
Some will contain experimental features, old methods, or use deprecated
features.  Please do not submit issues based on a problem that originates
in or is exposed by these plugins!
