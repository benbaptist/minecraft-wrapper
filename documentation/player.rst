**< class Player(object) >**

    .. code:: python

        def __init__(self, username, wrapper)

    ..

    This class is normally passed as an argument to an event
    callback, but can be also be called using getPlayer(username):

    .. code:: python

        player = self.api.getPlayer(<username>)

    ..

    Player objects contains methods and data of a currently
    logged-in player. Most features are tied heavily to
    proxy mode implementations and the proxy client instance.
    Player creation happens at one of two points:
     1) Proxy - at the player.preLogin event when the client first joins
     the wrapper proxy.  It is created by core.events.py in response to
     player.pre-Login's missing player argument.
     2) Non-proxy - Created at the player.login event when they join the
     local server.

    The player object has a self.__str___ representation that returns the
    player.username.  Therefore, plugins do not need to attempt string
    conversion or do explicit references to player.username in their code
    (str(player) or player.username in plugin code). There is also an
    additional property for getting the username: `name`

    When using events, events in the "proxy" (Group 'Proxy') section are only
    available in proxy mode.  "server" events (Group 'core/mcserver.py')
    are available even without proxy mode, as long as the server is running.


    Supported properties of the player:
    
    .. code:: python

        self.username  # client username on this server.
        self.loggedIn  # time the player object logged on.

        self.name  # property that returns the username
        self.uuid  # property that returns the very best UUID available.
        # self.uuid polls for the first UUID it finds in the list below.
        # self.uuid is also the only uuid that is a string type

        # These UUIDs are a MCUUID object.  Warning: they will not json
        #  serialize unless you convert them to a string!
        # To specifically get a certain uuid:
        self.mojangUuid
        self.clientUuid  # usually = self.mojangUuid (proxy mode only)
        self.offlineUuid
        self.serverUuid  # usually = self.offlineUuid in proxy mode.

        # These are available to non-proxy mode wrappers:
        self.loginposition
        self.playereid
        self.ipaddress

        # proxy only
        #-----------
        # player.client is the player client instance.  See the
        #  mincraft.api for getting packet constants for use with
        self.client
        self.clientUuid
        self.clientgameversion
        self.clientboundPackets = Packets_cb(self.clientgameversion)
        self.serverboundPackets = Packets_sb(self.clientgameversion)

        # some player properties associated with abilities (proxy)
        # default is 1.  Should normally be congruent with speed.
        self.field_of_view = float(1)
        # Client set godmode is 0x01
        self.godmode = 0x00
        # Client set creative is 0x08
        self.creative = 0x00
        # default is 1
        self.fly_speed = float(1)

    ..

    
-  connect(self, ip="localhost", port=25600)

        Connect to another server.  Upon calling, the client's current
         server instance will be closed and a new server connection made
         to the target port of another server or wrapper instance.

        Any such target must be in offline-mode.
        The player object remains valid, but is largely ignored by this
         server.
        The player may respawn back to this server by typing `/hub`.

        :Args:
            :port: server or wrapper port you are connecting to.
            :ip:  the destination server ip.  Should be on your own
             network and inaccessible to outside port forwards.

        :returns: Nothing

        
-  execute(self, string)

        Run a command as this player. If proxy mode is not enabled,
        it simply falls back to using the 1.8 'execute' command. To 
        be clear, this does NOT work with any Wrapper.py or plugin 
        commands.  The command does not pass through the wrapper.  
        It is only sent to the server console (or the actual server in
        proxy mode).

        :arg string: full command string send on player's behalf to server.

        :returns: Nothing; passes the server or the console as an
         "execute" command.

        
-  getClient(self)

        Deprecated - use `player.client` to Access the proxy client...

        Returns the player client context. Retained for older plugins
        which still use it.

        TODO - Deprecate by wrapper version 1.5 final.

        :returns: player client object.

        
-  getDimension(self)

        Get the player's current dimension.

        :Proxymode Note:  The player's Dimension is obtained by parsing client
         packets, which are not sent until the client logs in to 
         the server.  Allow some time after server login to verify 
         the wrapper has had the oppportunity to parse a suitable 
         packet to get the information!
         
         :returns: the player's current dimension.

             :Nether: -1
             :Overworld: 0
             :End: 1

        
-  getFirstLogin(self)

        Returns a tuple containing the timestamp of when the user
        first logged in for the first time, and the timezone (same
        as time.tzname).

        
-  getGamemode(self)

        Get the player's current gamemode.
        
        :Proxymode Note:  The player's Gamemode is obtained by parsing client
         packets, which are not sent until the client logs in to 
         the server.  Allow some time after server login to verify 
         the wrapper has had the oppportunity to parse a suitable 
         packet to get the information!
         
        :returns:  An Integer of the the player's current gamemode.

        
-  getGroups(self, uuid=None)

        Returns a list of permission groups that the player is in.

        :arg uuid: Optional MCUUID/string UUID of a (different) player.

        :returns:  list of groups

        
-  getHeldItem(self)

        Returns the item object of an item currently being held.

        
-  getItemInSlot(self, slot)

        :Proxymode: Returns the item object of an item currently being held.

        
-  getPosition(self)

        Get the players position
        
        :Proxymode Note:  The player's position is obtained by parsing client
         packets, which are not sent until the client logs in to 
         the server.  Allow some time after server login to verify 
         the wrapper has had the oppportunity to parse a suitable 
         packet to get the information!

        :Non-proxymode note: will still work, but the returned position will
         be either the player's login position or where he last teleported
         to...
        
        :returns: a tuple of the player's current position x, y, z, 
         and yaw, pitch of head.
        
        
-  hasGroup(self, group, uuid=None)

        Returns a boolean of whether or not the player is in
        the specified permission group.

        :arg group: Group node (string)
        :arg uuid: Optional MCUUID/string UUID of a (different) player.

        :returns:  Boolean of whether player has permission or not.

        
-  hasPermission(self, node, another_player=False, group_match=True, find_child_groups=True)

        If the player has the specified permission node (either
        directly, or inherited from a group that the player is in),
        it will return the value (usually True) of the node.
        Otherwise, it returns False.  Using group_match and
        find_child_groups are enabled by default.  Permissions
        can be sped up by disabling child inheritance or even
        group matching entirely (for high speed loops, for
        instance).  Normally, permissions are related to
        commands the player typed, so the 'cost' of child
        inheritance is not a concern.

        :Args:
            :node: Permission node (string)
            :another_player: sending a string name of another player
             will check THAT PLAYER's permission instead! Useful for
             checking a player's permission for someone who is not
             logged in and has no player object.
            :group_match: return a permission for any group the player
             is a member of.  If False, will only return permissions
             player has directly.
            :find_child_groups: If group matching, this will
             additionally locate matches when a group contains
             a permission that is another group's name.  So if group
             'admin' contains a permission called 'moderator', anyone
             with group admin will also have group moderator's
             permissions as well.

        :returns:  Boolean indicating whether player has permission or not.

        
-  isOp(self, strict=False)

        Check if player has Operator status. Accepts player as OP
        based on either the username OR server UUID (unless 'strict'
        is set).

        Note: *If a player has been opped since the last server start,*
        *make sure that you run refreshOpsList() to ensure that*
        *wrapper will acknowlege them as OP.*

        :arg strict: True - use ONLY the UUID as verification

        :returns:  A 1-10 (or more?) op level if the player is currently
         a server operator.

        Can be treated, as before, like a
        boolean - 'if player.isOp():', but now also adds ability
        to granularize with the OP level.  Levels above 4 are
        reserved for wrapper.  10 indicates owner. 5-9 are
        reserved for future minecraft or wrapper levels.  pre-1.8
        servers return 1.  levels above 4 are based on name only
        from the file "superops.txt" in the wrapper folder.
        To assign levels, change the lines of <PlayerName>=<oplevel>
        to your desired names.  Player must be an actual OP before
        the superops.txt will have any effect.  Op level of 10 is
        be required to operate permissions commands.

        
-  kick(self, reason)

        Kick a player with 'reason'.  Using this interface (versus the
        console command) ensures the player receives the proper disconnect
        messages based on whether they are in proxy mode or not.  This will
        also allow hub players to respawn in the main wrapper server.

        
-  message(self, message="", position=0)

        Sends a message to the player.

        :Args:
            :message: Can be text, colorcoded text, or chat dictionary of json.
            :position:  an integer 0-2.  2 will place it above XP bar.
             1 or 0 will place it in the chat. Using position 2 will
             only display any text component (or can be used to display
             standard minecraft translates, such as
             "{'translate': 'commands.generic.notFound', 'color': 'red'}" and
             "{'translate': 'tile.bed.noSleep'}")


        :returns: Nothing


        
-  openWindow(self, windowtype, title, slots)

        :Proxymode: Opens an inventory window on the client side.  EntityHorse
         is not supported due to further EID requirement.  *1.8*
         *experimental only.*

        :Args:
            :windowtype:  Window Type (text string). See below
             or applicable wiki entry (for version specific info)
            :title: Window title - wiki says chat object (could
             be string too?)
            :slots:

        :returns: None (False if client is less than 1.8 version)


        Valid window names (1.9)

        :minecraft\:chest: Chest, large chest, or minecart with chest

        :minecraft\:crafting_table: Crafting table

        :minecraft\:furnace: Furnace

        :minecraft\:dispenser: Dispenser

        :minecraft\:enchanting_table: Enchantment table

        :minecraft\:brewing_stand: Brewing stand

        :minecraft\:villager: Villager

        :minecraft\:beacon: Beacon

        :minecraft\:anvil: Anvil

        :minecraft\:hopper: Hopper or minecart with hopper

        :minecraft\:dropper: Dropper

        :EntityHorse: Horse, donkey, or mule

        
-  removeGroup(self, group, uuid=None)

        Removes the player to a specified group.

        :arg group: Group node (string)
        :arg uuid: Optional MCUUID/string UUID of a (different) player.

        :returns:  (use debug logging to see any errors)

            :True: Group was found and .remove operation performed
             (assume success if no exception raised).
            :None: User not in group
            :False: player uuid not found!

        
-  removePermission(self, node, uuid=None)

        Completely removes a permission node from the player. They
        will inherit this permission from their groups or from
        plugin defaults.

        If the player does not have the specific permission, an
        IndexError is raised. Note that this method has no effect
        on nodes inherited from groups or plugin defaults.

        :arg node: Permission node (string)
        :arg uuid: Optional MCUUID/string UUID of a (different) player.

        :returns:  Boolean; True if operation succeeds, False if
         it fails (set debug mode to see/log error).

        
-  resetPerms(self, uuid=None)


        resets all user data (removes all permissions).

        :arg uuid: Optional MCUUID/string UUID of a (different) player.

        :returns:  nothing

        
-  say(self, string)

        Send a message as a player.

        :arg string: message/command sent to the server as the player.

        Beware: *in proxy mode, the message string is sent directly to*
        *the server without wrapper filtering,so it could be used to*
        *execute minecraft commands as the player if the string is*
        *prefixed with a slash (assuming the player has the permission).*

        
-  sendBlock(self, position, blockid, blockdata, sendblock=True,
                  numparticles=1, partdata=1)

        :Proxymode: Used to make phantom blocks visible ONLY to the client.
         Sends either a particle or a block to the minecraft player's client.
         For blocks iddata is just block id - No need to bitwise the
         blockdata; just pass the additional block data.  The particle
         sender is only a basic version and is not intended to do
         anything more than send something like a barrier particle to
         temporarily highlight something for the player.  Fancy particle
         operations should be custom done by the plugin or someone can
         write a nicer particle-renderer.

        :Args:

            :position: players position as tuple.  The coordinates must
             be in the player's render distance or the block will appear
             at odd places.

            :blockid: usually block id, but could be particle id too.  If
             sending pre-1.8 particles this is a string not a number...
             the valid values are found here

            :blockdata: additional block meta (a number specifying a subtype).

            :sendblock: True for sending a block.

            :numparticles: if particles, their numeric count.

            :partdata: if particles; particle data.  Particles with
             additional ID cannot be used ("Ironcrack").

        :Valid 'blockid' values:

-  sendCommand(self, command, args)

        Sends a command to the wrapper interface as the player instance.
        This would find a nice application with a '\sudo' plugin command.

        :sample usage:

            .. code:: python

                player=getPlayer("username")
                player.sendCommand("perms", ("users", "SurestTexas00", "info"))

            ..

        :Args:
            :command: The wrapper (or plugin) command to execute; no
             slash prefix
            :args: tuple/list of arguments.

        :returns: Nothing; passes command through commands.py function
         'playercommand()'.  The player will receive any player.message()
         the command generates, if any.  Console commands in particular
         may only show their output at the console.

        
-  setGamemode(self, gamemode=0)

        Sets the user's gamemode.

        :arg gamemode: desired gamemode, as a value 0-3

        
-  setGroup(self, group, creategroup=True, uuid=None)

        Adds the player to a specified group.  Returns False if
        the command fails (set debiug to see error).  Failure
        is only normally expected if the group does not exist
        and creategroup is False.

        :Args:
            :group: Group node (string)
            :creategroup: If True (by default), will create the
             group if it does not exist already.  This WILL
             generate a warning log since it is not an expected
             condition.
            :uuid: Optional MCUUID/string UUID of a (different) player.

        :returns:  Boolean; True if operation succeeds, False
         if it fails (set debug mode to see/log error).

        
-  setPermission(self, node, value=True, uuid=None)

        Adds the specified permission node and optionally a value
        to the player.

        :Args:
            :node: Permission node (string)
            :value: defaults to True, but can be set to False to
             explicitly revoke a particular permission from the
             player, or to any arbitrary value.
            :uuid: Optional MCUUID/string UUID of a (different) player.

        :returns: Nothing

        
-  setPlayerAbilities(self, fly)

        :Proxymode: *based on old playerSetFly (which was an unfinished
         function)*

        NOTE - You are implementing these abilities on the client
         side only.. if the player is in survival mode, the server
         may think the client is hacking!

        this will set 'is flying' and 'can fly' to true for the player.
        these flags/settings will be set according to the players
        properties, which you can set just prior to calling this
        method:

            :getPlayer().godmode:  Hex or integer (see chart below)

            :getPlayer().creative: Hex or integer (see chart below)

            :getPlayer().field_of_view: Float - default is 1.0

            :getPlayer().fly_speed: Float - default is 1.0

        :arg fly: Boolean

            :True: set fly mode.
            :False: to unset fly mode

        :Bitflags used (for all versions): These can be added to
         produce combination effects.   This function sets
         0x02 and 0x04 together (0x06).

            :Invulnerable: 0x01
            :Flying: 0x02
            :Allow Flying: 0x04
            :Creative Mode: 0x08

        :returns: Nothing

        
-  setResourcePack(self, url, hashrp="")

        :Proxymode: Sets the player's resource pack to a different URL. If the
         user hasn't already allowed resource packs, the user will
         be prompted to change to the specified resource pack.
         Probably broken right now.

        :Args:
            :url: URL of resource pack
            :hashrp: resource pack hash
        :return: False if not in proxy mode.
        
        
-  setVisualXP(self, progress, level, total)

        :Proxymode: Change the XP bar on the client's side only. Does not
         affect actual XP levels.

        :Args:
            :progress:  Float between Between 0 and 1
            :level:  Integer (short in older versions) of EXP level
            :total: Total EXP.

        :returns: Nothing

        
-  uuid(self)

        @property
        Return the very best UUID available as a string, with
        the goal of never returning improper things like False and None.
